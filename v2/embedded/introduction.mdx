The following sections will help you get started with setting up your embedded integration hub. You can use the Versori platform to build and manage integrations between your internal systems and external APIs. The platform provides a set of tools and services that make it easy to connect, transform, and automate data flows between different systems.

The embedded integration hub allows you to embed a native integration hub into your own application for your users. This means that you can provide your users with a seamless experience when it comes to integrating their systems with the Versori platform.

The embedded integration hub is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to customize the look and feel of the integration hub to match your application. You can also configure the integration hub to work with your specific use cases and requirements.
