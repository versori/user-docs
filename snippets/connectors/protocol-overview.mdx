The platform provides native interoperability with a number of different protocols, and how connectors are onboarded
depends on these protocols:

- HTTP - OpenAPI
- GraphQL - Schema Introspection
- SOAP - WSDL

HTTP and GraphQL Connectors can also be created manually via API calls, but this is not yet supported in our UI.

Versori can also support additional protocols and if you require support for one not listed above, such as FTP, S3 or
SQL, please get in touch and weâ€™d be happy to help.
