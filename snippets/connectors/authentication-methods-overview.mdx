Systems authenticate users in many different ways and Versori offers a suite of different options in order to provide
full coverage of all these different implementations.

Most implementations follow standardised processes which make it easy for integration platforms like Versori to connect
to these systems. Other implementations however, are not always as simple. Versori offers two solutions to this problem,
users can define custom HTTP requests to make to external services, with the ability to extract data from the response
to be used as credentials on subsequent requests. Alternatively, users can write custom code in the form of a JavaScript
function which can be used to authenticate with the external system.
