A [Board](/legacy/concepts/boards) defines a single integration between one or more systems. The platform provides users
a drag-and-drop workflow builder which can be used to connect systems together, alongside additional tools to perform
your own business logic such as filtering and transformations.

When a Board is deployed, Versori creates dedicated compute resources to execute your integrations. Any webhook
receivers used in your integrations get a dedicated URL which you can use to connect the external system to your
integration.
