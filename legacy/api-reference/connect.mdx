description: Our next-generation API for connecting to your external systems.

import { Badge } from '/snippets/Badge.mdx';

Connect API allows you to connect to your external systems to the Versori Platform.

The main component of the Connect API are Connectors. Connectors are split into the following components:

-   Protocol
-   Authentication Scheme
-   Connections
-   Global Parameters
-   Actions
-   Triggers
-   Definitions

## Protocol

The protocol defines the transport mechanism used to communicate with your external system.

<Note>
    Currently, only HTTP/REST APIs are supported within Connect API, however our legacy "Apps" functionality is
    available on [Switchboard API](/legacy/api-reference/switchboard-api) which supports GraphQL APIs and SOAP web services.
</Note>

## Authentication Scheme

The authentication scheme defines how the Versori Platform will authenticate with your external system. Different
schemes are applicable to different protocols.

### HTTP

The following authentication schemes are supported for HTTP:

-   OAuth 2.0
-   OIDC
-   API Key (in header, query or cookie)
-   Basic
-   Bearer

## Connections

Each Connector has at least one connection and additional connections can be added. Connections are used to connect to
different instances of your external system. For example, you may have a development, staging and production connection,
each with different credentials and addresses. Each Connection must provide a Credential which satisfies one
authentication scheme for the Connector. Connections can define variables, which can be used to customise certain
aspects of the Connector such as default values for certain fields/parameters.

Finally, some protocols may require specific configuration for each connection. For example, the HTTP Protocol requires
a base URL for each connection.

## Global Parameters

Global Parameters allows a user to configure a set of parameters which can be used across multiple Actions. Within the
UI, whenever a user starts to create a new Action the UI will pre-populate the Action with the Global Parameters. If the
Action in question does not require any of these parameters the user may delete them before saving.

When a user creates, updates or deletes a global parameter, the user will be prompted to choose which Actions should
reflect the change, with the ability to choose all, some or none.

### HTTP Parameters

For HTTP Connectors, the following parameter types may be set as Global Parameters:

-   Path parameters
-   Query parameters
-   Headers

## Actions

Actions define the actions that can be performed on your external system. An action may be defined and implemented
differently depending on the protocol. For example, an HTTP Action contains a method like GET, PUT, POST etc., whereas a
BigQuery Actions will contain a SQL query.

### HTTP

For HTTP Connectors, each Action defines a single HTTP request.

The Action can contain inputs to customise the request, some inputs may also allow default values which can be
overridden when used within other Versori products. Default values can be defined using connection variables.

The supported HTTP inputs are:

-   Path parameters
-   Query parameters
-   Headers
-   Request body Definitions (one per supported media-type)

The Action can also define outputs:

-   Headers
-   Status Codes, and their associated Response body Definitions (one per supported media-type)

## Triggers

Triggers define how the Versori Platform will be notified of events from your external system. Each Protocol determines
how Triggers are defined since how they are implemented may vary.

### HTTP Triggers

These are essentially webhooks, which an external service may invoke to notify the Versori Platform of an event. They
are modelled similarly to HTTP Actions, but Versori expects a certain request and allows the user to configure the
response.

In the future, you will also be able to define HTTP Trigger Lifecycles, which define how a webhook is created/deleted on
the external system when a Switchboard integration is published/unpublished. However, this is out of scope for the
initial release.

## Definitions

Definitions provide the Versori Platform the information required to validate and provide auto-complete behaviour when
dealing with input/output data between connectors.

Each definition has a media-type and an associated schema. Which schema implementation is used depends on the
media-type, we initially support the following:

-   `application/json`, defined by JSON Schemas.
-   `text/xml`, defined by XML Schema Definitions (XSDs).
-   `text/csv`, how this is defined isn't known yet, however there are discussions in JIRA about this.

## Versioning

Except for the top-level Connector data and their Connections, other aspects of a Connector such as Actions, Triggers
and Definitions are versioned resources. A connector can have multiple versions and each version can either be in
"draft" or "published" state. A version is published if its `publishedAt` field is not null.

Versions are defined as an arbitrary string, but users are encouraged to follow a consistent versioning scheme such as
SemVer, CalVer, or an incrementing number.

Connectors may only be used by Versori products if they are published, and once published they are immutable. If an edit
is attempted against a published version then an error will be returned. Unpublished Connectors are considered to be in
"draft" and can be edited as many times as required.

Connectors may be unpublished, but only when they are not referenced by any other system (see
[Subscribers](#Subscribers) below).

### Special Versions

There are two reserved words to reference a published version, "latest" and "default". "latest" will always return the
latest published version according to it's `publishedAt` field, whereas "default" will return the version which has been
set as such by the user. If the user never specifies a default version, the "latest" published version will be used.

### Publishing Versions

When a new version is published, the user should be prompted to choose how Versori products should handle the update.
For example, for Switchboard the user should be able to choose whether to update existing integrations to use the new
version, or to leave them as they are. To facilitate this UX the Connect API has the concept of subscriptions (is there
a better name?) where other APIs can register their interest in a Connector.

## Subscribers

A Connector has the concept subscribers, where other products can notify the Connect API of their interest in that
connector. This allows the Connect API to check whether a Connector is being used by other products and prevent deletion
if so.

### Switchboard

When a board is published, the Switchboard orchestrator will subscribe to the Connector. When that board is then
unpublished, the orchestrator will unsubscribe from the Connector.

## Completions

</Badge>

Completions is an advanced feature of the Connect API which enables Connector authors to define how a particular field
within a Definition may be auto-completed. This is useful for fields which are almost always a fixed value but whose
valid values are determined by how the external system is configured. i.e. the `channel` field in a Slack `postMessage`
call must be a valid channel name for the Slack Workspace in which the Connector is connecting to.

There are different mechanisms for defining Completions which are described below.

### Static Completions

Static Completions are defined by the Connector author and are a fixed list of values. For JSON Definitions, this is
automatically generated by properties with the `enum` keyword. Other media-types will have their own mechanisms which
may or may not be directly supported by their schema implementation.

### Remote Completions

Remote Completions make a connector to an external API to retrieve the valid values for a field. Initially a Completion
can be defined by choosing another Connector Action, and a transformation on how to extract the values to present to the
user.
