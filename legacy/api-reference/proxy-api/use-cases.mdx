title: Use Cases

This section outlines some possible use cases of where the Proxy API can be useful.

## Embedded Integration Hub

This is most useful when building an Embedded Integration Hub and you need to make requests to external systems on the
user's behalf in order to provide the best user experience.

For example, if you want to provide your own End Users the ability to connect your SaaS platform to an external system,
like Slack, you may want the user to choose from a list of channels to post messages to. Before the Proxy API, each
use-case like this required a specific workflow to be implemented in your Integration. Now, you can use the Proxy API to
make requests to the Slack API directly from your application and show the results to the user.

Another use case for this functionality is when a Connection requires some Connection Variables to be defined to make
requests from a Board. This situation is common when your Connector defines a dynamic base URL such as subdomain or a
region/data-center, but this information can only be known by making a request using the user's credentials after they
have connected through Versori. Here, you can create a Connection as normal, then use the Proxy API to retrieve the
value of a Connection Variable, then use the [Update Connection][update-connection-api] API to set the value of the
Connection Variable.

## Testing Connectors

After onboarding a [Connector][connector] to the Platform, providing the OpenAPI specification or the manually created
Actions are valid, prior to the Proxy API there was no other way to test the Connector's functionality without building
a Board to actually use the Connector.

With the Proxy API, users can now send requests to the system and validate that the Connector is working as expected.

### Testing Connections

Similar to testing Connectors, users can test the Connection to ensure that the credentials are correct and the system
responds as expected. This is particularly useful for credentials which are manually inputted by the user without
validation, for example API Key or Basic Authentication. However, even for OAuth 2.0 connections using
`authorization_code`, which requires proper authentication and will fail if provided invalid data, there's still the
chances that the required `scope` for an operation is not granted, or the user has revoked the access.
