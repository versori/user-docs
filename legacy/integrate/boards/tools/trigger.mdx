A Trigger allows you to schedule automated actions with precise timing and frequency controls.
You can set when the action starts, how often it repeats, and on which days it should run.

### Basic Settings

- **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your trigger
- **Description:** Add details about the trigger's purpose or function

### Schedule

-   **Start Time/Date** - The time and date to start the schedule. The formats must be the same as the default values.
-   **Unit** - The unit of time to use for the schedule. Options: "Second", "Minute", "Hour", "Day", "Week", "Month".
-   **Frequency** - The frequency of the schedule. For example, if you choose "2" and "Hours", the schedule will run
    twice every hour.
-   **Include Days** - The days of the week to include in the schedule. For example, if you choose "Monday" and
    "Wednesday", the schedule will only run on those days.
