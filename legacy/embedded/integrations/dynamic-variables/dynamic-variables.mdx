title: Dynamic Variables
description: Use dynamic variables to customise integrations for each of your End Users.
---

You can configure which dynamic variables are required by your end users in the Dynamic Variables section of the Board
Builder. Then when your users activate the integration, they will be prompted to provide the required values.

## Configuration

In the Board Builder sidebar, click on the Board Variables Icon. Here you can add, edit and delete dynamic variables and
global variables.

<Note>
    Global variables are similar to dynamic variables, however they are static across all end users. They are useful for
    storing configuration values that are the same for all end users.

On the sidebar that pops up you can add and delete dynamic variables. When adding a new variable you, you must give it a
`name` and a `type`.

## Usage

Dynamic variables are useful to customise integrations for each of your End Users. For example, you may want to use the
their email address as a dynamic variable.

You can also onboard the embedded api as a connector and update them within your integration. A good use case for this
is if you are synchronising data between two systems, you may want to store the timestamp of the last sync as a dynamic
variable.

Dynamic variables are accessible wherever selectors can be used. Simply select Dynamic Variables from the source drop
down and click into `Dynamic Variables` to select the variable you want to use.
