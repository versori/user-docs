title: Dynamic Extractor

The Dynamic Extractor tool allows you to set the end-user for the execution. Connectors that use dynamic connections
after the Dynamic Extractor will use the end-user credentials for the connector. Additionally any dynamic variable
selectors will use the values defined for the user.

### Configuration

To configure the Dynamic extractor you need to use a selector to choose the end-user uinique identifier.

### Example usage
