title: 'Filter'
description: 'The filter action allows you to filter the resulting data based on a series of conditions.'
---

The filter accepts one input and one output. The input is the data to be filtered, and the output will be the data that
passes the filter.

### Use cases

The filter action is one of Switchboards method to provide conditional logic, so for example:

Imagine you have a list of users, and you want to remove any users that aren't active for use further along your
workflows. You can do this by using the filter action and setting the condition to `user.active` + `Equal to` + `true`.

<Note>
    Remember that the Filter passes forward values that pass the defined rules and conditions, rather than filtering out
    those values.

### Configuration

The filter is a multi condition interface - with two operators - `AND` and `OR`. These rules can be paired with `IF` and
`NOT IF` to create complex conditional logic.

The filter supports being able to filter based on a literal field value, or by using a selector to a previous field
value.

#### Available Conditions

Values passing through the filter can be combined in rules with varying conditions, such as `Equal to` and `Exists`. See
more options below:

#### Grouping Conditions

Rules can also be grouped to provide multiple levels of validating whether values should be filtered or not.
