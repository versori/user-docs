    'The Trigger Action is used as a startpoint within your flows, to trigger requests either manually or on a schedule.'

Boards can be triggered in two ways:

-   Webhooks
-   Trigger + Request

Webhooks are triggered externally - therefore Switchboard executes every time an event is received on our Listeners.

For Requests that aren't webhooks - they need to be triggered either by another Node, or by a Trigger Node.

### Configuration

The Trigger Node has two configuration options:

-   **Manual** - This will trigger the Node manually, when you click the "Play" button at the top of the Board Editor.
-   **Schedule** - This will trigger the Node on a schedule, based on the your configuration in the board.

### Usage

When in Scheduled mode, you can configure:

-   **Start Time/Date** - The time and date to start the schedule. The formats must be the same as the default values.
-   **Unit** - The unit of time to use for the schedule. Options: "Second", "Minute", "Hour", "Day", "Week", "Month".
-   **Frequency** - The frequency of the schedule. For example, if you choose "2" and "Hours", the schedule will run
    twice every hour.
-   **Include Days** - The days of the week to include in the schedule. For example, if you choose "Monday" and
    "Wednesday", the schedule will only run on those days.
