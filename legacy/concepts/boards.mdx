## Glossary

In order to understand Boards, it is important to understand the following terms:

- **Board**: A collection of steps that define a workflow.
- **Step**: A single piece of functionality within a Board.
- **Edge**: A connection between two steps.
- **Execution**: A single run of a Board.
- **Trigger**: A step that starts a Board.
- **Message**: The data that flows between steps.

## Steps

A Board is defined by a series of steps, where the output of a step feeds into zero or more subsequent steps, and each
step provides a single piece of functionality. Trigger steps are the start-point of a Board, and when they are triggered
an Execution is created and the steps are processed in order.

A step may be connected to multiple other steps, which allows for branching the flow of data. When this is configured,
the branches execute in parallel.

A step may also be configured to output multiple pieces of data, for example the Splitter tool takes a data array and
outputs each element of the array as a separate message

There are many different types of steps available, and more are being added all the time. These fall into two
categories: Connectors and Tools.

### Connector Step

A Connector step is a step that interacts with an external system and references a
[Connector](/legacy/concepts/connectors) which defines its behaviour. These can be one of two types: Actions or
Triggers. Actions are steps that perform a specific operation on an external system, such as creating a new record in a
CRM, while Triggers are steps that wait for an external system to perform an operation to Versori, such as a webhook.

### Tool Step

There are many types of tools available in Versori, each providing a different piece of functionality. These are
explained in more detail in the [Tools](/legacy/integrate/boards/tools) section, but are listed here for reference:

- Transformer
- Filter
- Data Builder
- Trigger (Manual or Scheduled)
- Data Mapper
- Splitter
- Delay
- Responder
- Email
- Variables
- Webhook
- Code
