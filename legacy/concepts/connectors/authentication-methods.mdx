The rest of this page covers our standard methods.

## OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 isn’t just a single method, but encapsulates many different methods, referred to as “grant types”, all
designed under the same standard. Versori offers native support for most of these grant types, if there is one not in
this list which you require then reach out to support to make a feature request. Most requests like this can be
addressed within a few days.

### Authorization Code

The `authorization_code` grant is the most commonly used grant type used for consumer-based applications, where users
are presented a popup to the system’s own login screen to enter their credentials (i.e. email and password). The system
obtains consent from the user for Versori to access their account on their behalf, and then provides Versori with
credentials (typically an `access_token` and `refresh_token`) which the platform uses to communicate with the external
system.

### Client Credentials

The `client_credentials` grant is the preferred option when there isn’t a user to act on behalf of, or in other words,
Versori is to be seen as a dedicated user when interacting with an external system.

### Password/Resource Owner

The `password` grant is generally not recommended over the `authorization_code` or `client_credentials` grant types, but
sometimes is the only option when interacting with a system which is outside of your control. This is implemented
similarly to the `client_credentials` grant, but instead of authenticating as a standalone client to the application,
you authenticate using a real user’s username and password.

## OIDC

OpenID Connect is built upon OAuth 2.0 but provides a set of standards in how identity information is shared between the
authorization server (i.e. your external service) and the client (i.e. Versori).

Versori supports the same grant types as OAuth 2.0.

## HTTP

There are two supported HTTP authentication schemes which are supported natively by Versori.

### Bearer Token

Users provide a token to use when authenticating to the system, and Versori attaches this token to all HTTP requests on
the “Authorization” header with the `Bearer` prefix.

### Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is configured by the user providing their username and password. This is then concatenated in the
form `{username}:{password}` and base64 encoded. This result is then attached to all HTTP requests on the
“Authorization” header with the `Basic` prefix.

## API Key

The API key Authentication Method allows specifying a token to send on requests where the token may be set in one of
three places:

-   Header - and the header name can be manually set
-   Query string - and the query parameter name can be manually set
-   Cookie - and the cookie name can be manually set

Versori does not do any other processing of the token such as added a static prefix to the token, so it’s important that
users connecting via API Key provide the token in its full form.

## HMAC Signatures

HMAC signatures are commonly used in applications supporting webhooks, however we’ve seldom witnessed their use in the
wild by client applications invoking requests to an upstream service.

Versori allows users to define how the payload to sign is constructed, i.e. some implementations just generate a
signature of the request body, or URL (with or without query params), or a combination of the two.

The algorithm used to generate the signature is also defined by the user, we support all major algorithms.
