## HTTP Connectors

These are the most common type of Connector, and are used when the external system exposes an API over HTTP. This is
most commonly a RESTful API however this is not a requirement and any service serving a HTTP server is supported.

HTTP Connectors are added to the platform by uploading an OpenAPI specification, currently version 3.0 and 3.1 are
supported. If you have a 2.0 specification (A.K.A a Swagger spec), we recommend using the converter which is available
at https://editor.swagger.io.

## GraphQL Connectors

<Warning>
    Currently, GraphQL Connectors are not fully supported via Connectors, but can be onboarded via
    [Apps](/legacy/switchboard/features/apps). Specific documentation can be found at [Onboard a GraphQL
    API](/legacy/switchboard/how-to-guides/apps/onboarding-apps/graphql-api).
</Warning>

GraphQL Connectors are similar to HTTP but designed around interacting with a GraphQL API. Upon onboarding a GraphQL
Connector we use schema [Introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) to identify the structure of the
graph. [Actions](https://www.notion.so/Actions-60ec97f011804323a7c9c02a9c5da8c5?pvs=21) are then created by defining the
query or mutation you wish to perform, and the platform identifies the correct response schema and any variables
required to execute the request.

### SOAP Connectors

<Warning>
    Currently, SOAP Connectors are not fully supported via Connectors but can be onboarded using our
    [Apps](/legacy/switchboard/features/apps) functionality.
</Warning>

SOAP is a recent addition to the platform and is still in beta. We recommend reaching out to support if you require help
building a SOAP integration. Although the feature is in beta, once the integrations are deployed and tested we provide
the same SLA as our other connectors.

## Protocol Roadmap

Versori strives to be an any-any integration platform, supporting all major protocols used for transmitting data between
systems. If you require a protocol not described above, please reach out to support@versori.com. The following is a
non-exhaustive list of protocols on our roadmap:

- FTP
- SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server dialects - if you wish to suggest another dialect weâ€™d be glad to hear them!)
- gRPC
- S3/GCS
- GCP PubSub
- AWS SNS
- NATS/JetStream
- AMQP (including RabbitMQ)
- MQTT
