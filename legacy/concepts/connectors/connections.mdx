## Connection Variables

For a connector you can define connection variables. These are used to replace elements of the base URL of the
connector. For example, if you have a connection variable called `apiBaseUrl` and the base URL of the connector is set
to `https://{{apiBaseUrl}}.example.com`, then the value of `apiBaseUrl` will be replaced in the base URL.

These variables are set on each connection, along with the credentials required to authenticate with the external
system. This is very useful for [embedded](/legacy/embedded/intro) integrations where you are integrating with a system
where each of your End Users could have their own instance hosted on a different domain. Using connection variables, you
can use one connector and your users can seamlessly connect to their own instances.
