<ConnectorsOverview />

Connectors are broken down into smaller pieces:

-   Protocol and protocol-specific metadata
-   Authentication Methods
-   Versions
-   Definitions
-   Actions
-   Triggers

## Connector Protocols

<ProtocolOverview />

A detailed breakdown of each supported protocol can be read on our Protocols page.

## Authentication Methods

<AuthenticationMethodsOverview />

See the Authentication Methods page for more info on the standard methods which we support natively.

## Versions

In order to support changes to a Connector without breaking existing integrations, Versori implements versioning against
particular resources which exist under a Connector.

Versions may exist in two states, either “draft” or “published”. Once published, a version and its resources are
immutable. Versions may be deleted, but if published is a destructive action and will cause any Boards using said
version to be un-deployed.

The following section, “Actions, Triggers and Definitions”, all exist within the scope of a particular Connector
Version.

### Actions, Triggers and Definitions

There are three main types of resources which exist within a Connector Version:

-   [Action](./connectors/actions) - defines how Versori can perform some operation against an external system, such as
    making an HTTP request.
-   [Trigger](./connectors/triggers) - defines how an external system can perform a request to Versori, such as an HTTP
    webhook from an external service.
-   [Definition](./connectors/definitions) - defines the data structures used by the action or trigger. For example,
    HTTP actions and triggers may contain definitions for each of the request and response bodies. Versori supports
    definitions in JSON Schema or XSD.
