An Action is an abstraction around how Versori executes some operation on a target system. There are multiple action
types, which are determined by the protocol of the connection it belongs to.

## HTTP Action

An HTTP Action defines an HTTP request which can be made to an external system. This is loosely modelled around OpenAPI,
specifically the [Operation Object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html#operation-object).

Definitions are used to define the request and response bodies, similar to OpenAPI, Versori supports multiple content
types and multiple response statuses.

## GraphQL Action

A GraphQL action is similar to a HTTP action, but defines the query/mutation(s) as part of the action. Definitions are
used to define the possible response bodies, but instead of a definition being used to model the whole request body,
instead it just defines the variables (if any) used to execute the request.

Upon creating or updating a GraphQL Action, the provided query is validated against the GraphQL Schema and the platform
will generate appropriate JSON Schemas for the variables and response body.

## SOAP Action

Again, SOAP is similar to HTTP Actions where it models a HTTP request to send to a SOAP web service.

Adding native XML support into Boards is part of the roadmap, but at the moment Boards only functions with JSON data
driven by JSON Schema definitions. As such, the main difference between SOAP and HTTP Actions is that thereâ€™s an
automated conversion between XML and JSON, and the platform stores both XSD and JSON Schema Definitions for the request
and response bodies. Upon execution of a SOAP Action, we use an automated mapping to convert the JSON to XML, perform
the request, and use another automated mapping to convert the response XML to JSON for the Board to continue execution.

## Action Roadmap

The action types on the roadmap are pretty much a one-to-one mapping to the Connector Protocols on our roadmap. See that
[section](./protocols) for more info.
