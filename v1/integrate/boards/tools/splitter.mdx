# What is Splitter?

The Splitter tool accepts a list input and processes each item individually. This allows you to handle each item in a
list separately within your Integration workflow.

## How the Splitter Works

The Splitter must be configured with a Selector to define its input. This Selector must be of a List or Array type. The
Splitter iterates over each item in the list and processes them one at a time.

Everything beyond the Splitter in the workflow will be executed for each item in the list. For example, if you have a
Splitter with a list of 10 items followed by a Slack Action, the Slack Action will execute 10 times—once for each
item—resulting in 10 Slack messages.

## Configuration

The Splitter tool has the following configuration options:

### Item Event Type

The Item Event Type is predefined with a default value and can generally be left unchanged.

### Item Content Type Override

The Item Content Type Override allows you to override the output content type. If left blank, it will inherit the
content type from the Selector you've chosen. In most cases, this can be left blank.

### Selector

The Selector is a crucial part of the Splitter configuration. It defines the list or array of items to be processed. The
Selector must reference a List or Array type data structure from previous steps in the workflow.

## Using Selectors in Splitter

By using selectors to access data from any previous step in the workflow, the Splitter can process each item in a list
individually. This provides granular control over how each item is handled in the Integration.

<Warning>
    Be mindful that actions following the Splitter will be executed for each item in the list. Ensure this behavior
    aligns with your workflow requirements to avoid unintended results, such as sending multiple messages or creating
    multiple records.
