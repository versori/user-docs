title: Creating a Hub
#api: 'POST https://platform.versori.com/api/embedded/v1/hubs'

From the platform dashboard, navigate to the "Embedded v2" section. If you haven't already created a Hub, you'll be
prompted to create one, otherwise the default Hub will be loaded, and you can create an additional Hub using the "+"
button in the top-right corner.

## Choose your Primary Connector

The first step in creating a Hub is to choose your Primary Connector. This is the Connector which represents your own
application for which the integration hub is built around. You can either choose an existing Connector, or create a new
one.

### Naming your Hub

Once you've chosen your Primary Connector, you'll be prompted to name your Hub. This can be any name you choose, but we
recommend it be something that represents your application, and potentially the environment if you plan to have multiple
Hubs.

### Choose your Authentication Method

If your Connector contains multiple [Authentication Methods](/v1/concepts/connectors/authentication-methods), you'll be
prompted to choose which method should be used by your End Users when connecting to your application.

<Tip>
    We recommend that all your End Users connect to a Connector using the same Authentication Method, however this is
    not enforced. When a Connection is created for an End User over API (which can be done when creating the End User,
    activating an Integration, or manually against a single Connector), it is possible to override the Authentication
    Method. However, support for this usage is not provided through our SDKs and the user is responsible for
    implementing their own UI to handle this.

## Hub Overview Dashboard

Once your Hub has been created, you'll be taken to the Hub Overview Dashboard. This is where you can manage your Hub,
Integrations and End Users.
