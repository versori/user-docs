Most SaaS applications have a need to integrate with other systems and offer these integrations to their customers,
however this comes with a number of challenges such as building and maintaining the integrations, and managing the
credentials of your users which have activated these integrations.

Versori Embedded provides a solution to these challenges by allowing you to embed a native integration hub into your own
application which is backed by integrations built in the platform. Versori provides multiple methods of embedding your
integration into your own application, from a simple React SDK which deals with the UI and authentication on your
behalf, to a fully-featured REST API allowing you to build your own UI.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to use our React SDK, however if you require more control over the UI it's
recommended to learn more about [how Versori Embedded works](/v1/embedded/how-it-works) before choosing your
implementation method.
