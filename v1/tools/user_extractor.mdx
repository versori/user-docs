The Email action allows you to send emials as part of your integration.

### Configuration

The email action doesn't have any configuration options but it expects the data it recieves to be in the following format:

```json
{
    "to": "",
    "subject": "",
    "body": "",
    "html_body": ""
}
```

`to` and`subject` are the only required options. The body if the email can be left empty.

`body` and `html_body` allow you to write a plain text email or styled email respectively.
