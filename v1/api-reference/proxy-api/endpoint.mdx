title: Endpoint
---

The Proxy API is made up of a single endpoint described by this page.

## Allowed Methods

This endpoint supports the commonly-used HTTP methods:

-   GET
-   POST
-   PUT
-   PATCH
-   DELETE

## Path Parameters

Requests to the Proxy API are sent to the following URL, with the parameters described below:

```
https://platform.versori.com/api/proxy/v1/{connection_id}/{path...}
```

<ParamField path="connection_id" type="string">
    The ID of the Connection to use for the request. The API will respond with a 404 if this Connection does not exist.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="path..." type="string">
    The remainder of the URL after `connection_id` is used as the path for the upstream request to the Connector
    identified by the provided Connection. This is appended to the base URL of the Connector (which can also be
    overridden by a special header - see [below](#special-headers)).
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

Any query parameters specified will be passed through to the upstream request. These are not processed by the Proxy API
with any special meaning.

## Headers

Any headers which begin with `X-Versori-` are not forwarded to the upstream request.

All other headers received by the Proxy API will be forwarded to the upstream request. This may include headers not
explicitly set by the user, for example those which are added by our own infrastructure (i.e. at load balancers or
reverse proxies), or any which are added by the browser if the requests are being made from a web application.

### Special Headers

There are a few headers which can modify the proxying behaviour:

<ParamField header="X-Versori-Connection-Variable" type="string">
    This header can be used to define Connection Variables which should be applied to the base URL of the request and
    override those already defined by the Connection.

    The format of this header is a url-encoded form (specifically, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) string, where
    each key-value pair is separated by an equals sign (`=`) and each pair is separated by an ampersand (`&`).

    Example:

    ```
    X-Versori-Connection-Variable: subdomain=example&region=eu
    ```

    This header may be specified multiple times, all values will be applied in the order they are defined, with later
    values overriding earlier ones.

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Versori-Ignore-Headers" type="string" >
    In certain circumstances, the Proxy API may receive some headers which are incompatible with the upstream system.
    This header can be used to specify a comma-separated list of headers which should be removed from the request before
    it is sent to the Connector.

    Example:

    ```
    X-Versori-Ignore-Headers: X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Proto
    ```

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Versori-Override-Base-Url" type="string">
    This header can be used to override the base URL of the Connector. This is useful when the Connector has a dynamic
    base URL, such as a subdomain or a region/data-center, and the value of this base URL is not known until the user
    has connected through Versori.

    Example:

    ```
    X-Versori-Override-Base-Url: https://example.com
    ```

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Versori-Force-Refresh-Credential" type="boolean">
    This header can be used to force the Proxy API to refresh the credential for the Connection before making the
    request. This is useful when testing a Connection can be refreshed without user interaction

    Example:

    ```
    X-Versori-Force-Refresh-Credential: true
    ```

</ParamField>

## Request Body

The request body is passed through to the upstream request without modification.
