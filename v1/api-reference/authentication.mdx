## API Keys

To create an API key, see the "API Keys" page from the account settings menu.

API Keys are provided in the `Authorization` header, using the `Bearer` prefix, i.e.

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

## Signing Keys

Signing Keys allows an Organisation to issue short-lived tokens which can represent itself, or for an End User of the Organisation.

Signing Keys consist of a RS256 key pair, Versori do not store the private key and once shared with the user, are unrecoverable. A signing key token is a JWT which has been signed by the keypair. These tokens are provided on requests to Versori APIs via the Authorization header using the JWT prefix.


### Key Generation

You can generate a new signing key pair through the Versori Platform. The private key will be returned to you along
with a `<KEY_ID>`. You will need to create and sign the JWT.


### JWT Creation and Submission

Versori uses the [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) standard to sign and verify tokens. You can use any JWT library to
create the token, like [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Python or [node-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) for Node.js.

You need to create a JSON object containing the following claims:
```
// end-user JWT
{
  "sub": "end_user",
  "iss": "https://versori.com/sk/:id"
}
```

`<END_USER_ID>` is the ID of the End User you want to authenticate.
`<KEY_ID>` is the ID of the keypair you want to use to sign the token.

We will also validate the `exp` (Expiration Time) and `nbf` (Not Before) Claims, if present.

An example JWT for an end user would look like this:

```
{
// end-user JWT
{
  "sub": "<END_USER_ID>",
  "iss": "https://versori.com/sk/<KEY_ID>",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "nbf": 1234567890,
}
```


Sign the token with the private key and encode it as a base64 string. The signing algorithm needs to be RS256.

After you have created the token, you can authenticate request by submitting it in the `Authorization` header, using the `JWT` prefix, i.e.

```
Authorization: JWT <YOUR_TOKEN>
```
