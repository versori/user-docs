The transformer takes a source input and a target output, allowing you to expand objects, iterate over arrays, and use selectors from previous nodes in your boards.

### Initial Configuration

The initial configuration of transformer assumes the source and target are the nearest connected nodes. To initialise the transformer, click configure:

#### Override Input

Additionally - you can configure the input to be from any previous node in your flow, this currently only supports selecting the $body property (the entire body of the selected node).
