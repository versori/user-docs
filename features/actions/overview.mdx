Switchboard Boards implement Actions. Actions are tools that can be used within your workflows for additional functionalities such as data transformation, filtering, conditional logic, save cross-system references, and more.

### Available Actions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transformer" icon="shuffle" href="/features/actions/transformer">
    This action allows you to transform data using a drag and drop interface -
    it allows you to expand objects, iterate over arrays, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filter" icon="filter" href="/features/actions/filter">
    This action allows you to filter data as it passes through your workflow.
    You can filter by a specific value, or by a condition, or by a combination
    of both.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Datamapper"
    icon="arrow-up-arrow-down"
    href="/features/actions/datamapper"
  >
    The datamapper is used to create a system reference between two entities of
    data - typically across different system. For example, you may want to map a
    customer from your CRM to a customer in your accounting system for future
    consideration/use within your flows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Splitter" icon="merge" href="/features/actions/splitter">
    This action accepts an input of an array property. The splitter will iterate
    through each item and perform the rest of the flow journey for each item.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Databuilder"
    icon="align-left"
    href="/features/actions/databuilder"
  >
    The databuilder is similar to the transformer, however provides a form
    interface with a user experience focused more on templating values, for
    example passing `{firstName} {lastName}` to create a full name.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch" icon="layer-group" href="/features/actions/batch">
    The batch action allows you to gather requests over a period of time and
    combine them into a single request.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delay" icon="clock" href="/features/actions/delay">
    Delay can be used to delay the execution of the next action in your
    workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trigger" icon="play" href="/features/actions/trigger">
    The trigger action can be used to trigger requests that otherwise would
    never be triggered externally, or if you want to trigger on a defined
    schedule - such as every 24 hours.
  </Card>
