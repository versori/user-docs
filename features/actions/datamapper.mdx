The Datamapper can be thought of as a key-value store for cross-system references. This can be useful for long running workflows that need to handle both creating and updating across external systems.

### Use Cases

Imagine you are managing an ecommerce integration into an ERP system. You have a workflow that creates a new product in the ERP system, and then updates the product with additional information from the ecommerce system when those updates happen at a later date.

If Switchboard isn't aware of what products are the same product across both systems - how can it know which product to update? This is where the datamapper comes in.

### How it Works

The Datamapper has two modes - `Check` and `Put`. The `Check` mode is used to check if a reference exists in the Datamapper storage. The `Put` mode is used to store a new reference in the Datamapper.

If in `Check` mode - the Datamapper has two outputs - one for if the reference exists, and one for when it doesn't:

</Frame>

If in `Put` mode - the Datamapper has one output - this is to allow the flow to carry on after creating the reference.

### Configuration

`Value Type` is the expected type of value to be saved.

A single saved reference in the Datamapper consists of a `Key` and a `Value`.

#### Key

The `Key` is typically the source system's ID for the entity to be saved.

`App Version` should be defined as something unique to your organisation - for example: `ecommerce-app.v1`. This allows this reference to also be used across other boards in your integration - if this app is used elsewhere.

`Kind` should be the type of entity being saved - for example: `product`. This allows you to save references for multiple types of entities in the same Datamapper app version.

`Value From` - this is the actual value from your board data that you wish to save a reference for. This could be a field from a previous action, or a value from a previous step in your workflow. Typically this will be an ID.

#### Value

The `Value` is only available to set in `Put` mode - seeing as we are creating a new reference in the Datamapper.

The configuration for `Value` is the same as `Key` - this is the partner stored against the key and will typically be the ID of your entity in your target system.

For example, `App Version` might be `erp-app.v1`, `Kind` might be `Item`, and `Value From` might be the ID of the `Item` in your ERP system.

### Using Datamapper with Selectors

The output of the data mapper will be on object in the form of:

```json
{
  "key": {
    "appVersion": "string",
    "kind": "string",
    "value": (Selected Value)
  },
  "value": {
    "appVersion": "string",
    "kind": "string",
    "value": (Value Type)
  }
}
```

This allows you to use the saved values in further selectors also.
