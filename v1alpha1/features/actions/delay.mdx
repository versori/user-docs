The Delay action is useful when you want to pause the workflow for a specific amount of time before continuing to the
next node. This is useful if you want to limit the time between requests or provide ample time for a background task to
complete.

### Configuration

The Delay action can be simply configured to delay by Seconds, Minutes, Hours, or Days:
