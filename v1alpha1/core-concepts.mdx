### Apps

Apps are the core building blocks of the platform. Each app is essentially an API.

Apps exist either as public (made available by Versori) or private (created by you).

When onboarding your own apps, we support multiple formats:

-   **OpenAPI 3.x.x** - An app that is defined by an OpenAPI 3.x.x specification. This is the most common type of app.
-   **GraphQL** - An app with configured GraphQL endpoints. We can use introspection to validate your queries and
    mutations.
-   **SQL** - A connection to an SQL database that's available on the internet.

When onboarding via OpenAPI - we automatically populate all operations into the platform, as well as defined
`securitySchemes`.

We are also progressively adding support for other types of apps, such as:

-   **SOAP** - An app that is defined by a SOAP specification.

And more to come...

### Connections

Connections exist against an app - whether you've created the app or it's one of the public apps made available by
Versori, you will need to connect to use your external account credentials within the platform.

We support multiple types of authentication:

-   **OAuth 2.0** - We support the following OAuth 2.0 flows:
    -   **Authorization Code** - This is the most common OAuth 2.0 flow. It's used by apps such as Google, Facebook, and
        many others.
    -   **Client Credentials** - This flow is used when you want to connect to an app as a service account.
-   **Basic** - This is the most basic form of authentication.
-   **API Key** - This is a simple key that is passed as part of your requests.
-   **Bearer** - This is a token that is passed as part of your requests.
-   **Database Connection** - This is a connection to an SQL database that's available on the internet.
-   **Custom HTTP** - This is a custom HTTP auth that you can define for dynamic implementations.

### Operations

Operations are the individual actions available within an app, such as `GET /customers` or
`PUT /customers/{customerId}`.

### Boards

Boards are the foundation of your integrations. A board is a graph of `nodes` and `edges` that define the flow of data
between your apps.

The Board Editor is a drag and drop interface that allows you to build your integrations visually, without having to
write any code.

Nodes can be made up of Apps and Actions. Edges are the connecting lines between nodes.

### Actions

Actions are the tools that implement various forms of logic within your workflows. They can be used to transform data,
perform conditional logic, and more.

We currently have the following actions available:

-   **Transformer** - This action allows you to transform data using a drag and drop interface - it allows you to expand
    objects, iterate over arrays, and more.
-   **Filter** - This action allows you to filter data as it passes through your workflow. You can filter by a specific
    value, or by a condition, or by a combination of both.
-   **Datamapper** - The datamapper is used to create a system reference between two entities of data - typically across
    different system. For example, you may want to map a customer from your CRM to a customer in your accounting system
    for future consideration/use within your flows.
-   **Splitter** - This action accepts an input of an array property. The splitter will iterate through each item and
    perform the rest of the flow journey for each item.
-   **Databuilder** - The databuilder is similar to the transformer, however provides a form interface with a user
    experience focused more on templating values, for example passing `{firstName} {lastName}` to create a full name.
-   **Batch** - The batch action allows you to gather requests over a period of time and combine them into a single
    request.
-   **Delay** - Delay can be used to delay the execution of the next action in your workflow.
-   **Trigger** - The trigger action can be used to trigger requests that otherwise would never be triggered externally,
    or if you want to trigger on a defined schedule - such as every 24 hours.

### Selectors

Selectors are used to select data from a previous action in your workflow. They can be used to select a specific
property, or to select the full response from any previous nodes.

Selectors can also be combined with Post Processors. Post Processors allow you to perform additional logic on the data
that you've selected, for example:

-   **Switch** - The switch post processor allows you to perform conditional logic on the data that you've selected.
-   **Size** - The size post processor allows you to get the size of an array.

Plus more...

### Publishing

When you're done building your integration, you can publish it to make it available to your users. When you publish your
board, each node is spun up into it's own service, with data messages passing over edges.
