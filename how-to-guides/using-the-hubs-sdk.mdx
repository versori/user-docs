## Add the SDK

#### Script tag

You can add the SDK in a script tag. This loads the main object Versori to the global window scope of the browser.

```htmk title="index.html"
<script src="pathToSDK" type="module" crossorigin></script>
```

## Initialise SDK

The SDK main Object provides an initialise function, accepting an object of options.

```js title="/src/components/integrationComponent.js"
function IntegrationComponent(props) {
  window.Versori.initHubs({
    userId: [USER_ID],
    orgId: [ORGANISATION_ID],
    apiKey: [PUBLIC_KEY],
    finaliseTo: [YOUR_ENDPOINT],
    onConnected: (connection, connectionInfo) => {},
    onDisconnected: (connectionInfo) => {},
    onCompleted: () => {},
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log(error.message, error.description);
    },
    onInitialised: () => {},
  });
}
```

### Options

#### userId (type: string, required: true)

The user ID for the current logged in user.

#### orgId (type: string, required: true)

The organisation ID for your Versori platform subscription where your Hubs are located.

#### apiKey (type: string, required: true)

A read-only public API Key set in your organisation settings inside Versori platform.

#### finaliseTo (type: string, optional: true)

The finaliseTo option is intended to be used as a direct url the SDK can POST connection details to after a connection has been made.

An example of this might be `https://clientUrl/api/receiveConnectionDetails`, where connection information will be sent directly.

#### onCompleted (type: Function, optional: true)

The onCompleted callback is called if a finaliseTo url is provided to a POST endpoint and the request was succesful. Here is where Frontend updates and any subseuqent processes can be handled.

#### onConnected (type: Function, optional: true)

The onConnected callback is used to return the connection details to the frontend after a connection is made to the integration. Returns App credential details and contextual information for Hub, Board and connected App.

<Warning>
  **Warning:** The SDK is intended to be used with one of either option -
  `finaliseTo` or `onConnected`. If `finaliseTo` is provided it will take
  precedence and the `onConnected` callback will not be called. If you require
  control over how the information is sent to your Backend then the
  `onConnected` callback would be the preferred option.
</Warning>

#### onDisconnected (type: Function, required: true)

The onDisconnected callback can be used to trigger a request to your backend where a request to the Versori DELETE user endpoint can be made. Returns the Hub ID and Board ID.

#### onError (type: Function, required: true)

The onError callback is triggered at any point in the flow when an error would prevent a connection being made. Useful to communicate to the user an error has occured.

#### onInitialised (type: Function, optional: true)

The onInitialised callback is called when the SDK has completed its mounted setup and the SDK is ready. Here is where any Front end updates dependant on the SDK being available can be handled.

## To Connect

Connections are triggered from elements containing specific data-attributes.

Below is an example of the data-attributes that are required per integration. What type of element you use is up to you, the important part is the data-attributes.

```jsx title="frontend/src/components/integrationComponent.js"
function IntegrationComponent(props) {
    ...
    return (
        <button
            data-vhubs
            data-vhubid=[YOUR_HUB_ID]
            data-vhubboardid=[YOUR_BOARD_ID]
        >
            Connect
        </button>
    );
}
```

---

## UI handling

You will be responsible to update the UI after a user has been created or deleted. It is required a [data-connected] attribute be set/unset on the element. Internally, on initalisation, the SDK sets a [data-connected] attribute, for each already connected integration, on the element you have provided the required data-attributes on.

<Warning>
  **Warning:** It is imperative the [data-connected] is toggled on
  create/delete. The SDK uses this attribute to trigger the correct flow from
  the event.
</Warning>

Below is an example of how UI updates could be handled in React.

```jsx title="frontend/src/components/integrationComponent.js"
function IntegrationComponent(props) {
    ...
    useEffect(() => {
        window.Versori.initHubs({
            ...
            onConnected: async (connection, connectionInfo) => {
                try {
                    // Make call to Backend and then createUser in Versori
                    const response = await callToYourBackend()
                    if (response.ok) {
                        handleButtonUpdate(connectionInfo.boardId)
                    }
                } catch(e) {
                    // Handle errors
                    console.log(e)
                }
            },
            onDisconnected: async (connectionInfo) => {
                try {
                    // Make call to Backend and then deleteUser in Versori
                    const response = await callToYourBackend()
                    if (response.ok) {
                        handleButtonUpdate(connectionInfo.boardId)
                    }
                } catch(e) {
                    // Handle errors
                    console.log(e)
                }
            }
        })
    }, [])


    const handleButtonUpdate = (boardId) => {
        // toggle [data-connected] on the element matching boardId and handle any other desired UI updates
    }

    return (
        ...
        <button
            data-vhubs
            data-vhubid=[YOUR_HUB_ID]
            data-vhubboardid=[YOUR_BOARD_ID]
        >
            Connect
        </button>
    );
}
```

## Valid Authentication types

The Versori Hubs SDK supports OAuth2 (oidc), API Key, and Basic authentication (username, password).

---

## Finalise Users Integration

Once a user has connected to Versori, the onConnected callback will provide connection information that you can use when sending a request to your Backend before then sending a POST request to the Versori create user endpoint.

`https://platform.versori.com/apis/switchboard/organisations/{orgId}/hubs/{hubId}/boards/{boardId}/users/{userId}`

<Warning>
  **Note:** Providing a `finaliseTo` endpoint will send connection details
  directly to your Backend and the `onConnection` callback will not be
  triggered.
</Warning>

```js title="backend/src/services/user/createUser.js"
function createUser(props) {
    const body = {
        environments: [
            {
                connectionId: connection.connection.id,
                credentialId: connection.connection.credentialId,
                key: connection.info.appKey,
                variables: null,
            },
            ...add any extra environments needed
        ],
        id: userId,
        variables: null,
    }
    const reponse = fetch(`https://platform.versori.com/apis/switchboard/organisations/{orgId}/hubs/{hubId}/boards/{boardId}/users/{userId}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(body)
    })
    const data = await response.json();

    console.log(data);
}
```

---

## Disconnect User from Integration

To disconnect a user, the onDisconnected callback can be used to send a POST request to your Backend before sending a POST request to the Versori delete user endpoint

`https://platform.versori.com/apis/switchboard/organisations/{orgId}/hubs/{hubId}/boards/{boardId}/users/{userId}`

```js title="backend/src/services/user/deleteUser.js"
function deleteUser(props) {
    const reponse = fetch(`https://platform.versori.com/apis/switchboard/organisations/{orgId}/hubs/{hubId}/boards/{boardId}/users/{userId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    })
    const data = await response.json();

    console.log(data);
}
```

## Destroy

The SDK exposes a destroy function on the window Versori object that will delete the SDK and remove all event listeners.

```js title="/src/components/integrationComponent.js"
function IntegrationComponent(props) {
  window.Versori.destroy();
}
```
