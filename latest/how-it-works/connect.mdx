Create or reuse Connectors for the systems you’re integrating and configure authentication.

- **Connectors**: Define base URL, protocols, operations, and auth schemes (e.g., API key, OAuth 2.0).
- **Connections**: Bind credentials and environment‑specific config to a Connector.
- **Reusability**: One Connector can serve multiple Projects; manage versions when APIs change.

Tips:

- Start with minimal scopes/permissions and expand as needed.
- For OAuth, test the full auth flow in a sandbox tenant first.
- Record paging, rate limits, and error shapes for downstream handling.
