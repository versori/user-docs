Implement your workflows and data mapping inside a Project.

Focus areas:

- **Workflows**: Define triggers, actions, scheduling, and branching for your use case.
- **Data mapping**: Transform and validate payloads; capture edge cases defined during planning.
- **Idempotency and retries**: Use stable keys and retry policies to avoid duplicates.
- **Observability**: Add logs and metrics for each step you need to monitor.

Testing:

- Run sample events end‑to‑end using representative data.
- Validate authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and error handling.

Next: [Deploy](./deploy)
