Plan the integration scope so you can build once and reuse across environments.

What to define:

- **Systems and auth**: Identify source/target systems and confirm the auth scheme.
- **Data model and mappings**: List objects and fields you need, with examples and edge cases.
- **Workflows**: Triggers, actions, schedules, retries, and idempotency requirements.
- **Success criteria**: SLAs, volume expectations, and observability needs.

Deliverables:

- A short solution outline covering the above.
- A checklist of test inputs and expected outputs.
