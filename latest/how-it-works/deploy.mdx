## Deploy

Promote your Project to production with active monitoring and automated maintenance.

Checklist:

- Confirm credentials for production Connections.
- Set environment variables, secrets, and rate‑limit guardrails.
- Enable alerting for failures and latency spikes.
- Define on‑call or escalation paths for critical workflows.

Post‑deploy:

- Monitor logs and metrics; tune retries and backoff as needed.
- Version and roll out updates safely; keep Connector versions aligned with upstream API changes.
- For End Users and Activations (same as legacy), follow the same lifecycle you used previously.
