The `projects` command (alias: `project`) provides subcommands for the full project lifecycle — creation, file management, deployment, logging, and more.


## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `activations` | Manage activations (end-user → environment links). Alias for the activation-lifecycle commands under `versori projects users`. |
| `asset` | Manage assets within a project |
| `create` | Create a new project in the current organisation |
| `deploy` | Deploy the project to versori |
| `details` | Get details for a project. Pass in - to read the project id from stdin |
| `edit` | Edit project environment configuration (resource limits and requests) |
| `environments` | Manage project environments |
| `files` | List or read files from a project |
| `issues` | List, inspect, and update issues for a project |
| `list` | Lists all projects in the current context |
| `logs` | Check the project logs |
| `proxy` | Send an HTTP request to a project's deployed environment |
| `save` | Save the project files to versori (no deploy) |
| `star` | Mark a project as a starred reference project for the organisation |
| `sync` | Sync pulls the project files to the local directory. Dry-run by default; pass --confirm to actually write. |
| `systems` | Manage systems within a project |
| `unstar` | Remove the starred flag from a project |
| `users` | Manage users (activations) within a project |
| `variables` | Manage a project's DynamicVariablesSchema (declares valid activation-variable keys) |
| `versions` | Manage versions within a project. |

### `versori projects files`


List files in a project, or print a single file's content to stdout.

With no arguments, lists files. Default -o table shows filename and size;
-o json and -o yaml include file contents too.

With a filename, writes that file's content verbatim to stdout so it can be
piped to other tools (jq, less, grep, etc.).

```sh
versori projects files [filename] [flags]
```


**Flags:**
* `-h`, `--help`: help for files
* `--project`: Project ID; defaults from .versori when inside a synced project directory.

* `--version`: Read files from a specific version id instead of the current files




---

### `versori projects issues`

---

### `versori projects list`




```sh
versori projects list [flags]
```


**Flags:**
* `-h`, `--help`: help for list
* `--starred`: Only list projects the organisation has starred



---

### `versori projects logs`




```sh
versori projects logs  [flags]
```


**Flags:**
* `--end`: Absolute window end (same formats as --start; defaults to 7 days after --start when omitted).

* `--environment`: The environment to retrieve logs for. e.g. (production, staging)

* `-h`, `--help`: help for logs
* `--limit`: How many logs to retrieve; 0 means no explicit limit
* `--project`: Project ID; defaults from .versori when inside a synced project directory.

* `--search`: Search query to filter logs
* `--since`: Trailing window from now (Go duration). e.g. 24h, 2h30m. Mutually exclusive with --start/--end.

* `--start`: Absolute window start (RFC3339, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, or YYYY-MM-DD). Mutually exclusive with --since.




---

### `versori projects proxy`


Proxy sends an HTTP request to a project's deployed environment and returns
the response. This allows triggering a project remotely via an HTTP call.

The --body flag accepts a raw string or @filename to read the body from a file.
When using @filename, the Content-Type header is automatically inferred from
the file extension unless explicitly provided via --header.

```sh
versori projects proxy --path <path> [flags]
```


**Flags:**
* `-b`, `--body`: Request body (string or @filename to read from file)
* `-d`, `--data`: HTTP POST data (alias for --body)
* `--environment`: Project environment name (e.g. production, staging)
* `-H`, `--header`: HTTP headers as key:value pairs (repeatable)
* `-h`, `--help`: help for proxy
* `-m`, `--method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS)
* `--path`: URL path to call on the integration (required)
* `--project`: Project ID; defaults from .versori when inside a synced project directory.

* `-q`, `--query`: Query parameters as key:value pairs (repeatable)
* `-X`, `--request`: HTTP method (alias for --method)
* `-u`, `--user`: Server user and password (e.g. user:password)

### `versori projects save`

```


**Flags:**
* `--assets`: Also upload assets from the versori-research directory
* `-d`, `--directory`: The directory containing the project files
* `--dry-run`: Print files that would be uploaded without actually saving
* `-h`, `--help`: help for save
* `--project`: Project ID; defaults from .versori when inside a synced project directory.




---

### `versori projects star`




```sh
versori projects star <project-id> [flags]
```


**Flags:**
* `-h`, `--help`: help for star



---

### `versori projects sync`


Sync pulls the project files to the local directory. The --project flag is only required the first time you sync a project.

Sync runs in dry-run mode by default and only prints what would be created, updated, or deleted. Pass --confirm to perform the real sync (which overwrites local changes and re-pins .versori).

WARNING: When --confirm is set, this will overwrite any local changes and delete any local files that are not part of the remote project.

```sh
versori projects sync [--project <project-id>] [--directory <directory>]
```


**Flags:**
* `--assets`: Also sync project assets, removing any that are no longer part of the project from the versori-research directory

* `--confirm`: Perform the actual sync. Without this flag, sync only prints what would change (dry-run).

* `-d`, `--directory`: The directory to download the project files into
* `--dry-run`: Force dry-run (the default when --confirm is omitted). Kept for explicitness; if both --dry-run and --confirm are set, --dry-run wins.

* `-h`, `--help`: help for sync
* `--project`: Project ID; defaults from .versori when inside a synced project directory.




---

### `versori projects systems`



See the [systems reference](projects/systems) for detailed subcommands to manage systems within a project.

### `versori projects unstar`

**Flags:**
* `-h`, `--help`: help for unstar



---

### `versori projects users`

### `versori projects variables`



See the [variables reference](projects/variables) for detailed subcommands to manage a project's dynamicvariablesschema (declares valid activation-variable keys)
.


---

### `versori projects versions`



See the [versions reference](projects/versions) for detailed subcommands to manage versions within a project..
