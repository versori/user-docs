The Versori Run SDK is a TypeScript library that provides entrypoints into the Versori Platform for building and running
integrations.

<Info>
    These sections are aimed at non-developer users who are building integrations via AI through the Versori Platform.
    The information is purposefully simplified for non-developers to understand the structure of the SDK and provide
    a glimpse into how Versori AI writes integrations.

    For a more developer-focused introduction, see the [Developers](/latest/run-sdk/latest/developers/overview) section.

## Quickstart

There are two ways to trigger an integration, via a webhook sent by the system you are integrating from, or via a
time-based schedule.

### Webhooks

The below example shows a webhook workflow which validates the request body contains a `question` field (we don't care
what the question is), and then responds with the answer to the question.

```typescript
import { webhook, fn } from '@versori/run';

const workflow1 = webhook('workflow1')
    .then(
        fn('validate-webhook', (ctx) => {
            if (typeof ctx.body !== 'object' || !ctx.body.question) {
                throw new Error('Invalid request body');
            }

            return;
        })
    )
    .then(
        fn('respond', () => {
            return {
                answer: 'The answer is 42',
            };
        })
    );
```

### Schedules

The below example shows a schedule workflow which runs every day at 10:00am (UTC), and logs a random number to the 
console.

<Note>
    We use [crontab](https://crontab.guru/) expressions to define the time period for the schedule. Versori AI should be
    capable of building your integrations to whatever schedule you need, however the link above is a useful tool to help
    define your own expressions.
</Note>

```typescript
import { schedule, fn } from '@versori/run';

const workflow2 = schedule('workflow2', '0 10 * * *').then(
    fn('log-random-number', ({ log }) => {
        log.info('Generated random number', { number: Math.random() });

        return;
    })
);
```

### Running workflows

On it's own, declaring the workflows as above will not do anything. You need to register the workflows with an
intepreter exported by the `@versori/run` package like so:

```typescript
import { webhook, schedule, fn, MemoryInterpreter } from '@versori/run';

// Workflow 1 & 2 declarations...
// ...

async function main(): Promise<void> {
    const interpreter = await MemoryInterpreter.newInstance();

    interpreter.register(workflow1);
    interpreter.register(workflow2);

    await interpreter.start();
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.error('Versori Run SDK Error', err);
});
```

The `MemoryInterpreter` is a simple interpreter that has no persistent state and can be horizontally scaled with ease. 
Other intepreters are documented in the developer documentation, but it should not be a concern for most users, the 
Versori Platform handles registering and starting workflows for you whenever workflows are added/updated/deleted from a 
Project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to build and run workflows, you can learn more about the different
components of the SDK and how to use them to build more complex integrations.
