The Versori Run SDK is a TypeScript library that provides entrypoints into the Versori Platform for building and running
integrations.

    When building integrations via the Versori Platform, our AI does the majority of the work for you, and should only
    require developer knowledge when building more complex integrations. If you ever need help, we can offer paid
    support or refer you to a partner who can help.

<Info>
    Whilst the Versori Platform is aimed to support non-developer users, it can sometimes help to understand a little 
    code to help the AI write better integrations. These "Getting Started" sections are aimed at non-developers to 
    understand the structure of the code written by the AI, and is purposefully simplified to cater for these users.
    
    For a more developer-focused introduction, see the [Developers](/latest/run-sdk/latest/developers/overview) section.

## Quickstart

There are two ways to trigger an integration, via a webhook sent by the system you are integrating from, or via a
time-based schedule.

### Webhooks

The below example shows a webhook workflow which validates the request body contains a `question` field (we don't care
what the question is), and then responds with the answer to the question.

```typescript
import { webhook, fn } from '@versori/run';

const workflow1 = webhook('workflow1')
    .then(
        fn('validate-webhook', (ctx) => {
            if (typeof ctx.body !== 'object' || !ctx.body.question) {
                throw new Error('Invalid request body');
            }

            return;
        })
    )
    .then(
        fn('respond', () => {
            return {
                answer: 'The answer is 42',
            };
        })
    );
```

### Schedules

The below example shows a schedule workflow which runs every day at 10:00am (UTC), and logs a random number to the 
console.

<Note>
    We use [crontab](https://crontab.guru/) expressions to define the time period for the schedule. Versori AI should be
    capable of building your integrations to whatever schedule you need, however the link above is a useful tool to help
    define your own expressions.
</Note>

```typescript
import { schedule, fn } from '@versori/run';

const workflow2 = schedule('workflow2', '0 10 * * *').then(
    fn('log-random-number', ({ log }) => {
        log.info('Generated random number', { number: Math.random() });

        return;
    })
);
```

### Running workflows

On it's own, declaring the workflows as above will not do anything. You need to register the workflows with an
intepreter exported by the `@versori/run` package like so:

```typescript
import { webhook, schedule, fn, MemoryInterpreter } from '@versori/run';

// Workflow 1 & 2 declarations...
// ...

async function main(): Promise<void> {
    const interpreter = await MemoryInterpreter.newInstance();

    interpreter.register(workflow1);
    interpreter.register(workflow2);

    await interpreter.start();
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.error('Versori Run SDK Error', err);
});
```

The `MemoryInterpreter` is a simple interpreter that has no persistent state and can be horizontally scaled with ease. 
Other intepreters are documented in the developer documentation, but it should not be a concern for most users, the 
Versori Platform's own AI handles registering and starting workflows for you whenever workflows are 
added/updated/deleted from a Project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to build and run workflows, you can learn more about the different
components of the SDK and how to use them to build more complex integrations.
