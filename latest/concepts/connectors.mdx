Connectors describe external systems (e.g., Shopify, NetSuite) and how to talk to them: base URLs, operations, and authentication.

Key concepts:

- **Authentication**: API key, OAuth 2.0, Basic, custom schemes. Choose the minimal scope needed.
- **Operations**: Define common requests (list, get, create, update). Document pagination, rate limits, and error shapes.
- **Versioning**: Publish new versions when upstream APIs change; keep Projects pinned to a compatible version.

When to create a new Connector:

- A new system or a materially different API variant.
- A versioned API change that breaks compatibility.
