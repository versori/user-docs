Connections bind environment‑specific credentials and settings to a Connector. They are what Projects use at runtime to call external systems.

Key concepts:

- **Credentials**: API keys, OAuth tokens, or custom secrets. Store securely and rotate regularly.
- **Environment config**: Sandbox vs production endpoints, feature flags, and rate‑limit policies.
- **Reusability**: Multiple Projects can use the same Connection when appropriate.

Lifecycle:

1. Create a Connection for a Connector.
2. Validate auth with a simple read operation.
3. Attach the Connection to a Project.
