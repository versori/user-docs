title: Run SDK
---

The Run SDK provides tools to execute and test Projects locally and in CI. It standardises configuration, secrets loading, and logging so that your build and runtime environments behave consistently.

Common tasks:

- Run a Project with local environment variables and mock Connections.
- Execute a single workflow with an input payload and capture logs.
- Configure retries and idempotency for test runs.

Coming soon:

- CLI reference, config schema, and CI examples.
