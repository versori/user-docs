## How it works

Follow the steps:
1. [Plan](./how-it-works/plan): Define scope, objects/fields, auth, and success criteria.
2. [Connect](./how-it-works/connect): Create or reuse Connectors and configure Connections.
3. [Build](./how-it-works/build): Implement workflows and transformations in a Project.
4. [Deploy](./how-it-works/deploy): Promote to production and enable monitoring.

## Concepts

Core building blocks youâ€™ll use throughout the platform:

- [Connectors](./concepts/connectors): Define systems, auth schemes, and operations.
- [Connections](./concepts/connections): Bind credentials and environment settings to a Connector.
- [Run SDK](./concepts/run-sdk): Execute and test Projects locally and in CI.
- [Deployment](./concepts/deployment): Promote Projects safely to production and operate them reliably.
