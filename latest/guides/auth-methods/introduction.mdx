Versori supports most standard authentication methods as well as partial support for custom methods. Whilst users are
in full control of the integration code, it's recommended to utlise Versori's [Run SDK](/latest/run-sdk) to interact
with external systems as this simplifies the integration logic as well as providing a more consistent and secure way
of managing credentials.

<Note>
Versori integrations are implemented in TypeScript and powered by [Deno](https://deno.com/), this means that you can
implement an integration to any system which supports HTTP. However for these edge cases, users are required to 
implement manual logic to apply authentication to any external requests (either by prompting or manually editing the 
code). See the [Run SDK](/latest/run-sdk/context/credentials) guide for more details on how to achieve this.

## Supported Methods

### OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a standard authentication method for web applications, and is the one most recommended to use where the
system being integrated supports it. 

Versori supports the following OAuth 2.0 Grant Types:

- [Authorization Code](/latest/guides/auth-methods/oauth2/authorization-code)
- [Client Credentials](/latest/guides/auth-methods/oauth2/client-credentials)
- [Password/Resource Owner](/latest/guides/auth-methods/oauth2/password-resource-owner)
- [Refresh Token](/latest/guides/auth-methods/oauth2/refresh-token)

See our [OAuth 2.0](/latest/guides/auth-methods/oauth2) guide for more details on how to configure each of these grant 
types.

### API Key

API Key is a standard authentication method for API applications. Versori supports arbitrary API keys which can be set
in the header, query string or cookie.

### HTTP Authorization

HTTP Authorization is a standard authentication method for HTTP applications where the credential is set in the 
"Authorization" header. Versori supports the following authorization schemes:

- Bearer
- Basic


### OAuth 1.0

OAuth 1.0 is a legacy authentication standard used in many enterprise, or more legacy, systems. 

<Note>
Our implementation has been tested against Netsuite's TBA implementation but should work with most other 
implementations. If you run into any issues with OAuth 1.0 authentication, please reach out to support.
