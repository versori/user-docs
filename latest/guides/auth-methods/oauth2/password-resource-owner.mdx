title: Password/Resource Owner
---

<Warning>
The `password` grant is generally not recommended over the `authorization_code` or `client_credentials` grant types, but
sometimes is the only option when interacting with a system which is outside of your control. This is implemented
similarly to the `client_credentials` grant, but instead of authenticating as a standalone client to the application,
you authenticate using a real userâ€™s username and password.
</Warning>
