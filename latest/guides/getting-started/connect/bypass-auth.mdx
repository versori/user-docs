title: Bypass Authentication
---

The Bypass Authentication feature enables users to send requests to the Connector, or process webhook traffic from a
Connector, without authentication.

<Warning>
    Bypassing authentication for a Connection will allow you send requests to the external system, or process webhook
    traffic, without authentication. This is not recommended and should only be used in rare cases where you need to
    connect to an external system without request authentication, such as services using an IP allowlist (see [IP
    Allowlist](/latest/guides/advanced/ip-allowlist) for more details).
</Warning>

## Configuring the Authentication Method

To bypass authentication for a Connection, select the "Bypass Auth" option. This creates a new Authentication Method for
the Connection called "None" with type "No Authentication" and the Connection section updates to allow you to configure
the base URL for the Connection, and a confirmation button to "Bypass Connection".

## Connecting to a Bypassed Connection

Once confirmed, a new Connection will be created and the Connection dropdown will indicate that the Connection is using
bypassed auth.

The Connection will be available to use in your Build, and any requests will be made to the base URL configured.

## Reverting a bypassed Connection

To revert a bypassed Connection, choose a different Authentication Method for the Connection. This should update the
Connection section to allow you to choose an existing Connection or create a new one.
