title: Starting your plan
---

The first step in building an integration is to plan the scope, this includes:

- **Systems and auth**: Identify source/target systems and authentication methods.
- **Business requirements**: What are you trying to achieve?
- **Type of integration**: Is this a real-time integration, a batch job, a bidirectional data sync, and/or a
  multi-tenant integration?
- **Data model and mappings**: List objects and fields you need, with examples and edge cases.

Users start by providing as much information about their integration as possible and uploading any attachments, this can
include screenshots, diagrams, PDF/Word documents, or even OpenAPI specifications.

Once the details above are submitted, Versori uses AI to perform in-depth research of the requirements and provides a
detailed plan of how the integration will be implemented.

## Research stage

<Steps>
    <Step title="Extract, Analyse & Search">
        Versori analyses all the information provided by the user, and extracts all relevant information, including
        scraping any URLs which may be included in the attachments or text provided by the user.

        This data is then analysed to identify any gaps in information which need to be filled.

        Additional web searches are performed to fill in any gaps in information, this may identify additional sources
        which can be extracted and analysed in a loop until the agent is satisfied that all information has been
        gathered.

        This produces two documents, an integration summary and technical resources.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Questions">
        The user is prompted to answer any outstanding questions which cannot be answered by the information
        gathered.

        These questions vary in importance, some questions are highly recommended to be answered before continuing,
        but other questions can be left blank and Versori will make assumptions based on the other information
        gathered.

        For more information on answering questions, see the [Questions](/latest/guides/getting-started/plan/questions) guide.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Next Steps">
        At this point, the user may choose next steps, either to start building the integration, or to refine the
        requirements by answering the outstanding questions and/or prompting with more

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Connect

<Note>
    It's possible the research stage has not identified all the systems which need to be connected, in this case you
    must prompt the research agent to identify any additional systems, providing more information if necessary.
</Note>

After the initial research step, you may notice the "Connect" tab has a badge denoting the number of Systems which have
been identified and requires configuration.

Our [Connect](/latest/guides/getting-started/connect) guide covers how to connect your systems, and how to manage these
connections over time.

## Generate Workflows

In addition to the Systems which require connecting, there is also a call-to-action to "Generate Workflows", which will
generate separate requirements prompts for each of the workflows which have been identified for your integration.

These prompts can then be entered into the "Build" tab to start building the actual workflows.

Our [Build](/latest/guides/getting-started/build) guide covers the Build tab and its capabilities.
