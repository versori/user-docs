title: Managing Connectors
---

This guide explores the Connect tab and explains how Connectors and Connections can be managed. To understand more about
how Connectors and Connections work within the Versori Platform, see the [Connectors](/latest/concepts/connectors) and
[Connections](/latest/concepts/connections) pages.

<Note>
    This guide does not dive into specific authentication methods, see [Authentication
    Methods](/latest/guides/auth-methods/introduction) for more details on the different methods available.
</Note>

The connect tab shows the user the Connectors which are in use by the Project, including the list of endpoints available
to each Connector. Here you can also manage authentication by configuring different authentication methods for each
Connector.

## Connectors

Connectors are the starting point in how Versori provides integrations to external systems. Unlike other iPaaS's,
Versori do not rely on “pre-built” connectors, we use AI to generate Connectors either by scraping API documentation or
from a user-provided OpenAPI specification.

<Note>
Currently only the AI can create Connectors, which can be prompted via either the Plan or Build tabs. Manual creation
of Connectors is not yet available via the UI, but can be done manually via our API.
</Note>

### Managing Connectors

When new Connectors are created via AI, they start off unconfigured without endpoints or authentication methods. If an
OpenAPI specification is provided, the configuration is automatically populated based on the specification.

For unconfigured Connectors, click the "Setup Connector with AI" button to start the process to automatically configure
the Connector, this can take a couple of minutes to complete. Once complete, selecting "Manage Authentication" will open
the Authentication sidebar where you can see what the AI has configured, make any adjustments, and create a Connection
for the Connector.

If you are happy with the configuration, click the "+ New Connection" button to create a Connection for the Connector. 
Otherwise, you can select "Manage Connector" to manually edit the Connector configuration.

Once you are happy with the configuration, click the "Create Connection" button to create a Connection for the
Connector.

#### Bypass Auth

See the [Bypass Auth](/latest/guides/connect/bypass-auth) guide for more details on how to bypass authentication for a
Connection.

## Connections

Connections are the way to connect to an external system. Each Connector can have multiple Connections, and each
Connection can have a different set of credentials and variables.
